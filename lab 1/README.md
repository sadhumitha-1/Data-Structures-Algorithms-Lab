# Lab 1 - Searching and Sorting

## Note:
1. Use only **Visual Studio Code** to type your program and run your code.  
2. Always follow industry coding best practices.  
3. To compile your file, follow the steps below:
   - Save your file as a `.cpp` file  
   - Go to the location where you have stored the file via terminal  
   - Compile as:  
     ```
     g++ -o objectfilename filename.cpp
     ```
   - Run as:  
     ```
     ./objectfilename
     ```

## Question 1

Write a C++ **menu-driven program** to sort a given array in ascending order.  
Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions, and follow coding best practices.  
The menus are as follows:

- a. Bubble Sort  
- b. Selection Sort  
- c. Insertion Sort  
- d. Exit

## Question 2

Convert the sorting program into a **header file** and include it into a new `.cpp` file.  
Write a C++ menu-driven program for **linear and binary search** in this new `.cpp` file.  

Utilize any of the sorting functions in the included header file to sort the input array before performing a binary search.  
Design proper functions, maintain boundary conditions and follow coding best practices.  

The menu-driven program supports:

- a. Linear Search  
- b. Binary Search  
- c. Exit

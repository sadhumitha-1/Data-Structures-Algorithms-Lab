# Lab 6 - Stack ADT – Array and Linked List

---

## Part A – Stack using Array

Write a separate C++ **menu-driven program** to implement **Stack ADT** using a **character array of size 5**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Push  
2. Pop  
3. Peek  
4. Exit  

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)

## Part B – Stack using Singly Linked List

Write a separate C++ **menu-driven program** to implement **Stack ADT** using a **character singly linked list**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Push  
2. Pop  
3. Peek  
4. Exit  

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)

## Part C – Infix to Postfix & Postfix Evaluation

Write a C++ **menu-driven program** to implement:
- Infix to Postfix conversion
- Postfix expression evaluation

Use a **singly linked list (SLL)** to implement the Stack ADT as a **header file**. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Get Infix  
2. Convert Infix  
3. Evaluate Postfix  
4. Exit  

#### Descriptions:

- **Get Infix**:  
  Accepts a valid infix expression and stores it efficiently.

- **Convert Infix**:  
  Converts the stored infix expression into a postfix expression.  
  Prints the postfix expression after conversion.

- **Evaluate Postfix**:  
  Calculates and prints the result of the converted postfix expression.

> Implement for **only arithmetic and assignment (`=`)** operators.  
> Follow the **precedence and associativity rules** given in the table below.

## Part D – Parenthesis Balance Checker

Write a C++ **menu-driven program** to get a string of `'('` and `')'` from the user and check whether they are **balanced**.  
Choose the **optimal ADT and data structure** for the problem.  
You may reuse previously implemented **header files**. Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Check Balance  
2. Exit  

#### Description:

- **Check Balance**:  
  Accepts a string of parentheses.  
  Displays whether the input is balanced or not.  
  Explore and consider at least **two designs/approaches** before finalizing your implementation.

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each solution, and what is the optimal solution?  
> Justify your answer. (K5)

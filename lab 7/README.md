# Lab 7 - Queue ADT – Array and List Implementation

---

## Part A – Queue Using Array

Write a separate C++ **menu-driven program** to implement **Queue ADT** using an **integer array of size 5**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Enqueue  
2. Dequeue  
3. Peek  
4. Exit  

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)

## Part B – Circular Queue Using Array

Write a separate C++ **menu-driven program** to implement **Circular Queue ADT** using an **integer array of size 5**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Enqueue  
2. Dequeue  
3. Peek  
4. Exit  

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)

## Part C – Queue Using Linked List

Write a separate C++ **menu-driven program** to implement **Queue ADT** using an **integer singly linked list**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Enqueue  
2. Dequeue  
3. Peek  
4. Exit  

>**Question:** What is the time complexity of each of the operations? (K4)

## Part D – Symbol Processing with Custom Logic

Take a string from the user consisting of characters and `'+'` symbols.  
Process the string so that the final output **does not include any `'+'` symbol and the immediate left non-'+' character**.

> Example:  
> **Input:** `45fgd+++ab+c`  
> **Output:** `45ac`

### Instructions:

- Choose and justify the **optimal ADT and data structure** for this problem.
- Implement the program by including the appropriate **header file**.
- Explore multiple designs before finalizing the optimal one.

>**Question:**  
> What is the time complexity of each solution?  
> What ADT and data structure will you use?  
> What is the optimal solution? Justify your answer. (K5)

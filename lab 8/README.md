# Lab 8 - Tree ADT – Binary Tree

## Part A – Block Towers Problem (Using C++ STL) (K5)

There are *n* block towers, numbered from 1 to *n*.  
The *i*-th tower consists of *a<sub>i</sub>* blocks.

In one move, you can move **one block** from tower *i* to tower *j*, **only if** *a<sub>i</sub> > a<sub>j</sub>*.  
That move increases *a<sub>j</sub>* by 1 and decreases *a<sub>i</sub>* by 1.

You can perform **as many moves** as you'd like (including zero moves).

### Problem Statement:

What is the **largest number of blocks** you can have on **tower 1** after performing the allowed moves?

### Input:

- The first line contains a single integer *t* (1 ≤ *t* ≤ 10⁴) — the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer *n* (2 ≤ *n* ≤ 2 × 10⁵) — the number of towers.
- The second line contains *n* integers *a₁, a₂, …, a<sub>n</sub>* (1 ≤ *a<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 10⁹) — the number of blocks in each tower.

> The sum of *n* over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10⁵.

### Output:

For each test case, print the **maximum number of blocks** you can get on **tower 1** after any number of valid moves.

## Part B – Binary Tree using Character Nodes

Write a **menu-driven C++ program** to implement **Tree ADT** using a **character-based binary tree**.  
Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices.

### Operations:

1. Insert  
2. Preorder Traversal  
3. Inorder Traversal  
4. Postorder Traversal  
5. Search  
6. Exit  

>### Question:

>What is the **time complexity** of each operation? (K4)
